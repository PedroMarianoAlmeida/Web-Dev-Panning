- Source: <https://youtu.be/e2IbNHi4uCI>

## Core Concepts

- The "HEAD" branch: The current branch that you are using
- Local x Remote branches: We work on Local branches, remote branches is for syncronazing

## Comands

### Create new branch
- From HEAD branch and last commit: ```git branch <my-new-branch>```
- From any other branch or commit ```git branch <my-new-branch> <commit-hashcode>```
- Obs: We create only LOCAL branches

### Switching Branches
- ```git checkout <other-branch>```
