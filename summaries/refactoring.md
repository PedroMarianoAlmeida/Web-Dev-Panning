# Refactoring

## Theory

### Clean Code Features

- Obvious or other programmers
- Doesnâ€™t contain duplication
- Contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts
- Passes all tests
- Easier and cheaper to maintain

### Technical Debt

- Write a not clean code to advance fast, but eventually this is slowing down the project until pay the debt (clean the code)

### When to reactor

- Rule of Three

  - First time: Just get it done
  - Second time: cringe at having to repeat but do the same thing anyway.
  - Third time: Start refactoring

- When adding a feature
- When fixing a bug
- During a code review

### Resulted after refactoring

- A cleaner code (if the code stays unclear, you lost time doing it)
- Without new features (features is one thing and refactoring is another, do not mix these two in the same modification)
- All existing test must pass (maybe you need to refactor the test too)
