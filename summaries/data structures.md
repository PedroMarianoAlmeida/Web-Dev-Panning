# Data Structures

## Linked List

- Composition

  - Node: Contain a value
  - Pointer: Address to next node

- First node: Head
- Last node: Tail (not has a pointer)

- Pros: Add and delete items
- Cons: Retrieval and search

## Arrays

- Pros: Retrieval data
- Cons: Adding items (sometimes - if it gets to big and need to be relocated internally)

## Hash Table

- It is the Object in JavaScript
- Pros: Add and delete items
- Cons: Key collisions (but only in low level languages)

## Stack and Queue

- Array with extra features
- Pros: Add and remove
- Cons: Limited use cases

### Stack

- First in - Last out
- Push: Add a new item in the end of array
- Pop: Remove a item in the end of array

### Queue

- First in - First out
- Enqueue: Add a new item in the end of array
- Dequeue: Remove a item in the begin of array
